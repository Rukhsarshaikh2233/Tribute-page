            <h3>Arshad Sharif: Mystery over killing of Pakistani journalist in Kenya</h3>
            <p> <b>The shooting dead of a prominent Pakistani investigative journalist by police in Kenya caused outrage in his home country, leaving many wondering how such a thing could have happened.</b>
                <br>
            Thousands turned up to Arshad Sharif's funeral on Thursday in Islamabad to mourn the well-known critic of Pakistan's military.

            Opponents of the current Pakistani government believe that he was targeted in a plot organised in Pakistan.

            But Kenya's police, in an initial report, said the 49-year-old was shot dead in a moving vehicle in a case of mistaken identity.

            Pakistan says it has sent investigators to Kenya to help with the inquiry into what took place.
