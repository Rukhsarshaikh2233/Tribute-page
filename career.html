            <h3>JOURNALISTIC CAREER</h3>
            <p> Sharif covered conflicts in tribal areas with the specialisation in defence and foreign affairs. He reported for leading Pakistani news organisations from London, Paris, Strasbourg and Kiel.
               
                <br>Arshad Sharif started his program Power Play on ARYNews in 2014 and the program proved to be a roaring success. The program focused on giving viewers new information rather than having discussions. Following this program HEC Privatisation had to be reviewed by the government. Sharif brought to attention that the Motorway project was going to Saifur Rehman of Ahtesaab Commission fame. He publicized the document signed by Saifur Rehman and Chairman NHA in China under the cover of a Chinese investment company.

                Sharif brought to attention one of the most controversial privatizations in the history of Pakistan, MCB. Sharif unearthed the long lost NAB report on MCB Privatisation that showed how Nawaz Sharif had handed the bank to Mian Mansha for small favours. Sharif also brought to attention the illegitimate purchase of St. James Hotel in London by Nishat Group. He was the first to bring to media attention the issue of Foreign Funding by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. After the program, the government actively began pursuing money laundering and foreign funding by PTI. </p></div>
